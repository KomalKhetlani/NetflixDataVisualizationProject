# NetflixDataVisualizationProject

In this project, I have taken the dataset from Kaggle which contains details like Show Id,  Type of Content,Title, Director, Cast,Country,Release year,Description and a few other parameters. I have analysed the data and then made visualizations which give beautiful insights about the data.

The Visualization is hosted at https://netflixdatavisualization.herokuapp.com/
